# Taskbar-Audio-Visualizer
This project is inspired from TranslucentTB and how it effects the windows taskbar.
I've always loved the idea of having a audio visualizer where my taskbar is so thats what this project aims to be!
so far you can choose bar color options, amount of bars, how big or small it is, and etc.

this project is vibe-coded meaning that i had AI do all the hard codeing tasks (VS-code github copilot) and i tried my best to guide it.
this also means that code probably wont be well optimized and may have bugs, so I'm sorry about that.

some fetures that i plan to add are program specific audio sources (kinda like windows audio mixer), more color custimizations and get Transparency to work (lol)

you can duble click the windows icon to open the settings quicker and theres a feture to help bring it to the frount 
(was going to have it say where the windows taskbar is but i ran into issues about how the windows taskbar REALLY seems to want to always be in frount :/ so yeah...)

there is a setting option to allow click-through abblity but that stops you from being able to click and drag it.
also settings seem to be "hard-coded" so you will have to manully set some things each time... still working on getting settings to save right :/
